# Tabalyst Scan plan

How Tabalyst Scan is built: lots, their status, the model and effort to use,
and how work moves from one conversation to the next. The contract is
[design.md](design.md); measurements are in [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md).

Every lot must leave the project releasable: tests and lint green, demos
regenerated, documentation consistent with what is released.

Status values: Planned, Next, In progress, Done, Blocked. The session that
works on a lot updates this table.

### Gates

The maintainer validates before the next lot starts:

- **Gate 0**, before 1a: the Proposed decisions of the design register
  (design.md section 1) become Accepted or are amended. Passed on 2026-09-26:
  all accepted without change.
- **Gate 1**, after 1b: reader contract, paths and presence semantics.
- **Gate 3**, after 3a: detector contract and ambiguity handling.
- **Gate 4**, before releasing `tabalyst scan`.
- **Gate 5**, before removing the pandas engine in 5c.

## Why these models

- **Opus 5.5, high effort** where an error spreads to everything built later:
  the design, reader contracts and presence semantics (1a, 1b), the detector
  contract (3a), the report migration (5a) and optimization choices (6).
- **Sonnet 5** where a written contract and failing tests already define the
  work: measures (2a, 2b), catalogue detectors (3b), the command and its
  documentation (4, 4-fr) and the pandas removal (5c). If a Sonnet session
  finds that the contract itself is wrong, it stops, records the problem in
  this file and proposes an Opus session to amend the design.
- Model and effort are chosen in the app's selector before sending the first
  message of the conversation.

## Conversations

- **One conversation per lot.** Never start a second lot in the same
  conversation: a fresh session reloads `AGENTS.md`, this plan and the design,
  whereas a long conversation is eventually compacted and loses detail.
- **The repository is the memory.** Decisions go to design.md, status and next
  steps to this file, history to `docs/dev/progress.md`. Nothing needed later
  may exist only in a conversation.
- **A lot too large for one conversation** stops at a coherent point, with
  tests green and the "Notes" of the lot updated with what remains; the next
  conversation continues the same lot with the same prompt.
- **Branches and worktrees.** One branch per phase, as in the table. The app
  can open a session in a worktree on that branch. Commits, merges, tags and
  pushes happen only when the maintainer asks.
- **Parallel sessions** are allowed only where marked below, each in its own
  worktree. Everything before 3b is sequential because each lot depends on the
  previous contract.

## Session ritual

At the start:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, this plan (the lot's section) and design.md.
2. Mark the lot In progress and add it to `ENABLED_LOTS` in
   `tests/scan/conftest.py`.
3. Propose the plan of the lot before editing anything.

At the end:

1. `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest` and
   `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .` pass, with the lot's contract
   tests enabled.
2. Regenerate both public demos with the commands in `examples/README.md`.
3. Update this plan (status, notes), design.md section 17 if the contract
   changed, and `docs/dev/progress.md`.
4. Run `/code-review` on the lot's changes and address the findings.
5. Propose a commit message; commit only if asked.
6. Propose the next conversation: lot, model, effort, branch and the starting
   prompt below, in the maintainer's conversation language.

## Starting prompt

```text
Tabalyst Scan, lot <ID>: <title>.
Read AGENTS.md, then docs/dev/scan/plan.md (lot <ID>) and docs/dev/scan/design.md.
Follow the session ritual of plan.md: enable lot <ID> in tests/scan/conftest.py,
propose your plan for the lot before editing, then implement until its contract
tests pass. At the end, complete the ritual and propose the next conversation.
```

## Lots

### Lot 0: design, contract tests, baseline

Done on 2026-09-26: design.md, contract tests for lots 1a to 3b (skipped until
enabled), benchmark tooling in `benchmarks/` and the baseline in
benchmarks.md.

### Lot 1a: engine core and CSV reader

- `tabalyst.scanner` package, `scan()` API, result models, `ScanConfig` with
  the complete schema of design section 15, hard caps and fingerprint.
- Paths: segments, display syntax and its parser (design section 4).
- Reader protocol and stream items; streaming CSV reader with SHA-256 computed
  while reading, strict and tolerant policies, positional identities.
- Engine, structure and presence counters, string categories, `missing`,
  `values.count`, diagnostics collector, scan status and scope.
- Done when: `tests/scan/test_scan_csv.py` passes. Reuse the CSV error
  messages of `ingestion.py` and `sampling.py` where they apply.
- Done on 2026-09-26; contract changes recorded in design section 17.

### Lot 1b: JSON reader, collections and structural limits

- Add `ijson` to the dependencies; verify wheels for Python 3.11 to 3.14 in CI
  (the pure-Python backend is the fallback).
- JSON reader with its own path stack; automatic and explicit collections;
  document, collection and scalar datasets; root field; arrays block.
- Structural limits: `max_fields`, `max_depth`, `max_record_observations`.
- Done when: `tests/scan/test_scan_json.py` passes. Then gate 1.

### Lot 2a: values, frequencies, limits and statistics

- Raw frequency tables keyed by native type, cardinality with proven bounds,
  global budget, long values, listings, samples, first and last values.
- String characteristics and lengths, exact numeric statistics, booleans,
  `not_applicable` measures, `measures_limited` diagnostic.
- Done when: `tests/scan/test_scan_measures.py` passes.

### Lot 2b: normalization version 1 and variant groups

- Stages, change counters that continue after table release, stage
  cardinalities, variant groups.
- Done when: `tests/scan/test_scan_normalization.py` passes.

### Lot 3a: detector framework, technical type, ported detectors

- Detector base class, registry, coverage, evidence, interpretations,
  isolation of failures, shape classifier.
- Execution modes: per distinct value while tables are complete, streaming with
  memoization afterwards (design section 13).
- Technical type inference ported from `analysis.py`.
- Ported and extended detectors: numbers (strict rule, then dot and comma
  decimal conventions with ambiguity), dates (current strict formats, ISO
  date-times and times, English and French month names), textual booleans,
  enumeration candidates.
- Done when: `tests/scan/test_scan_detectors.py` passes. Then gate 3.

### Lot 3b: priority 1 catalogue, patterns, sensitive values

- First, in one session: `detectors.md` (one short specification per
  detector, design section 12.9), the pattern detector and the exposure gate
  (`tests/scan/test_scan_patterns.py`).
- Then catalogue families, which may run as parallel sessions in separate
  worktrees: email and URL; phone (CA, US, FR); postal codes (CA, US ZIP);
  currency and percentage; UUID and IP addresses.
- Each detector adds its own positive, negative, variant and overlap tests.

### Lot 4: `tabalyst scan` command, configuration layers, documentation

- `tabalyst scan INPUT... [-o | -d] [--config] [--collection] [--force]`,
  default output `data.scan.json`, atomic writes (design section 16.3).
- Shared batch planning with `report` and `sample`, progress by bytes read.
- `scan` section in `tabalyst.json`, configuration layers and merge rules;
  top-level `tabalyst.scan()` and `tabalyst.generate_scans()`.
- Documentation in `docs/en/`: how-to, scan format reference and changelog,
  configuration, glossary, known limitations; README. Note the follow-up needed
  in `tabalyst-studio`. Then gate 4 and release preparation.

### Lot 4-fr: French documentation

- Translate the lot 4 pages to `docs/fr/` with the glossary. Can run in
  parallel once the English pages are merged.

### Lot 5a: report built on Scan

- Adapter from `ScanResult` to the report, profile format revision 3, parity
  tests on both demos, decision on how the report presents date ambiguity and
  evidence (design section 12.6).

### Lot 5b: JSON sources and new report sections

- `tabalyst report data.json`, sections for detectors and formats,
  normalization variants, limits and structure; browser checks at desktop and
  mobile sizes; a public JSON demo in `examples/`.

### Lot 5c: reuse, duplicates, pandas removal

- `tabalyst report --scan data.scan.json` with the staleness rule (O12).
- Duplicate records in streaming under a budget.
- Remove `ingestion.py`, the pandas parts of `analysis.py` and the pandas
  dependency after gate 5.

### Lot 6: measure, set targets, optimize

- Scan benchmarks next to the baseline, including 10 million rows, wide files,
  long strings and deep JSON; targets decided with the maintainer (O19).
- Fast paths, adaptive detection with explicit `not_tested`, mergeable states
  as preparation for parallelism.

### Lot 7: extensions

One conversation per topic, each starting with a short design addition:
catalogue waves 2 to 5 and profiles (Sonnet 5, medium); Excel, XML, database
and API readers, exact quantiles, parallel execution and plugins (Opus 5.5,
high, for their design).

## Notes

Lots record here what remains when a conversation stops before the lot is
done, and anything the next lot must know.

- Lot 0: the current report engine resolves date ambiguity from evidence in
  the same column; Scan exposes that evidence without applying it (design
  section 12.6). Lot 5a must decide how the report presents it.
- Lot 1a, for lot 1b:
  - `scanner/api.py` rejects `.json` sources with "not supported yet"; lot 1b
    replaces that with the JSON reader and sets `scope.collections`
    (`null` for CSV).
  - The engine already handles any path, the root field (listed only when a
    record is not an object), items presence (`absent: null`), the `arrays`
    block and `f<n>` identifiers. Unit behavior for JSON is not tested yet:
    `test_scan_json.py` is the reference.
  - Provisional choices to confirm at gate 1: the `name` of an items field is
    `"[]"` and of the root field `"$"`; `missing.components.absent` is `null`
    for items fields and counts as 0 in `missing.count`; a field's `parent` is
    `null` for top-level fields even when the root field is listed.
  - `structure` is always `complete` with zero untracked and truncated
    observations; lot 1b adds `max_fields`, `max_depth` and
    `max_record_observations` (`RecordExcluded` with reason
    `record_too_large` under the tolerant policy).
  - `RecordExcluded.index` counts every record read, so indices of analyzed
    records have gaps after exclusions.
  - Open for gate 1: the CSV reader keeps the default `csv.field_size_limit`
    (131,072 characters), so a longer cell is a fatal quoting error, as in the
    current engine. Raising it changes process-wide state and lets one cell
    use unbounded memory; decide on a bounded, configurable cell limit with the
    structural limits.
- Lot 1a, for lot 6: indicative measure, not a benchmark row: 1 million rows
  of `synthetic-1m.csv` in about 13 s with 77 MB peak memory, counters only.
  Each cell creates one `Observation`; a CSV fast path is an option for lot 6.
